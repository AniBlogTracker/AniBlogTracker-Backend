# AniBlogTracker (Backend)
AniBlogTracker allows users to discover posts from various Anime and Manga blogs in one place. It checks various blogs, newsletters, and videos and show them in one feed with the anime title detected from the title or post content.

This is the backend, which provides a JSON REST API, which the frontend uses.
